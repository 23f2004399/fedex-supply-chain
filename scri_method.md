# SCRI Methodology – Final Implementation Summary (with Calibration)

## Objective

The goal is to develop a **Supply Chain Resilience Index (SCRI)** that quantifies the resilience of each customer (or node) in the supply chain based on:

- Frequency of disruptions  
- Severity (cost/revenue impact)  
- Lead time delays  

This enables ranking of nodes from most to least resilient, with robust statistical evaluation.

---

## Step 1: Data Grouping & Feature Mapping

The following groupings were used to extract core disruption dimensions from the raw dataset:

```python
group_cols = {
    'Frequency': ['Order Id'],  
    'Severity': ['Sales per customer', 'Order Item Quantity', 'Order Item Product Price'],
    'LeadTime': ['Days for shipping (real)', 'Days for shipment (scheduled)', 'Order Item Total']
}
````

The respective normalized components were constructed as:

```python
df_norm['F_norm'] = df_norm['Order Count']
df_norm['S_norm'] = df_norm[['Sales per customer', 'Order Item Quantity', 'Order Item Product Price']].mean(axis=1)
df_norm['L_norm'] = df_norm[['Days for shipping (real)', 'Days for shipment (scheduled)', 'Order Item Total']].mean(axis=1)
```

## Step 2: SCRI Calculation with Three Weighting Schemes

We calculated three variants of SCRI using the following weighting methods:

### 1. **Heuristic Weights** (expert judgment)

```python
heuristic_weights = np.array([0.4, 0.35, 0.25])
```

### 2. **PCA-derived Weights** (data-driven variance explained)

```python
X = df_norm[['F_norm', 'S_norm', 'L_norm']]
pca = PCA(n_components=3)
pca.fit(X)
pca_weights = pca.explained_variance_ratio_
pca_weights /= pca_weights.sum()
```

Yields (example):
`PCA-derived Weights: [0.527, 0.352, 0.121]`

### 3. **Equal Weights** (uniform importance)

```python
equal_weights = np.array([1/3, 1/3, 1/3])
```

### Final SCRI Scores

```python
df_norm['SCRI_heuristic'] = X.dot(heuristic_weights)
df_norm['SCRI_pca'] = X.dot(pca_weights)
df_norm['SCRI_equal'] = X.dot(equal_weights)
```

## Step 3: Evaluation – ROC & PR Curves

Since no external labels exist, we created a **natural heuristic label**:

```python
f_thresh = df['F_norm'].quantile(0.50)
s_thresh = df['S_norm'].quantile(0.50)
df['label'] = ((df['F_norm'] >= f_thresh) & (df['S_norm'] >= s_thresh)).astype(int)
```

We then evaluated each SCRI variant using:

* **ROC-AUC** (discrimination)
* **PR-AUC** (precision-recall tradeoff)
* **Brier Score** (calibration loss)
* **Calibration slope/intercept**

---

## Step 4: Calibration Methods

To improve calibration (probability alignment), we applied:

1. **Platt Scaling (Logistic Regression Calibration)**
2. **Isotonic Regression Calibration**

We computed calibration slope/intercept *before and after calibration*.

## Step 5: Results

### Discrimination Performance

| SCRI Variant    | ROC AUC | PR AUC | Brier Score |
| --------------- | ------- | ------ | ----------- |
| SCRI\_heuristic | 0.862   | 0.654  | 0.194       |
| SCRI\_pca       | 0.880   | 0.708  | 0.193       |
| SCRI\_equal     | 0.834   | 0.615  | 0.196       |

### Calibration Slopes / Intercepts

| SCRI Variant | Raw Slope / Intercept | Platt-Calibrated | Isotonic-Calibrated |
| ------------ | --------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------- |
| Heuristic    | 16.81 / -4.99         | 1.068 / 0.031    | 1.000 / 0.000       |
| PCA          | 16.32 / -4.25         | 1.055 / 0.024    | 1.000 / 0.001       |
| Equal        | 15.36 / -5.00         | 1.070 / 0.034    | 1.000 / 0.000       |

---

## Step 6: Sensitivity Analysis

We evaluated SCRI's robustness to small perturbations in input features:

| Scenario          | Δ SCRI (Avg) |
| ----------------- | ------------ |
| Frequency CV -15% | -0.0101      |
| Frequency CV +15% | +0.0101      |
| Severity +20%     | +0.0103      |
| Severity -20%     | -0.0103      |

SCRI responds proportionally and consistently to perturbations.

---

## Conclusion

* **Discrimination:** All SCRI variants achieve ROC-AUC ≥ 0.83.
* **Calibration:** Raw scores were poorly calibrated (slope \~15).

  * **Platt scaling** corrected slopes to \~1.05.
  * **Isotonic regression** achieved nearly perfect calibration (slope ≈ 1.00, intercept ≈ 0.00).
* **Best method:** PCA-weighted SCRI (highest AUC + calibrated slope in \[0.9, 1.1]).
* The SCRI framework is now both **discriminative** and **well-calibrated**, making it reliable for prioritizing vulnerable nodes in the supply chain.
